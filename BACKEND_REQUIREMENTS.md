## Overview

The Espresso Restaurant Management App is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline restaurant operations including customer check-in, table management, order processing, and reservation systems. This document outlines the backend requirements necessary to support the mobile application.

## System Architecture

### Tech Stack Recommendations
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching/session storage)
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage
- **Message Queue**: Redis or RabbitMQ for background tasks
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket with Socket.io for live updates

### Architecture Pattern
- Microservices architecture with separate services for:
  - Authentication Service
  - Customer Management Service
  - Table Management Service
  - Order Management Service
  - Reservation Service
  - Reporting Service
  - Notification Service

- **Manager**: Access to management features
- **Staff**: Access to customer and table management
- **Waiter**: Access to order and customer management
- **Cook**: Access to order preparation features

### Permission Matrix
| Feature | Owner | Manager | Staff | Waiter | Cook |
|---------|-------|---------|-------|--------|------|
| Customer Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Table Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Order Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Reservation Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reporting | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Settings | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

- Customer PII stored with additional encryption

### API Security
- Rate limiting (100 requests/minute per IP)
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention with proper output encoding
- CORS configured for frontend domains only

### Authentication Security
